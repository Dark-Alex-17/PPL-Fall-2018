The starting materials for Project 2 are in the
Corgi folder, and in the Documents folder
(page 51 of the file implementation.pdf).

The file corgiCFG.txt has the grammar, and
important comments, including the fact that
Corgi now allows  /* ..... */ style comments,
and a list of the built-in functions.
