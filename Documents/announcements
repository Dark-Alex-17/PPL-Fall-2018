=======================================

Exercise 2:

   The command (occurring two places):

       2 1001 1

   is misleading, because the "1" is a conceptual error
   (in an earlier version of VPL, I though the call had
    to speciy how many arguments had been passed, but now
    we just say that the command 3's have to immediately
    precede the command 2)
    but I didn't notice this issue because the loader
    sees opcode 2, reads one further argument (1001), and
    tosses the rest of the line---it's just as if the "1"
    is a comment.
